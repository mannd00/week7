# Re: An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer

### Writing Code

My first impression of this reading, is that it’s less of a Industry Guide as one man’s opinions on the matter, which he does state that these are his opinions not necessarily fact. However I do agree with him about having good coding practices and keeping things well documented with comments to assist others who you are collaborating with and to help yourself in the future if and when you need to come back to the code to make modifications and fixes. Writing code that is maintainable is an important thing to keep in mind when creating programs and scripts. If you need to do something once, there's a strong possibility you’ll need to do it again in the future. Not coding in a way that can be taken and reused again and maintained easily as requirements and need change only hurts yourself when you come back and need to update it.

### Linux

Being familiar with Linux and comfortable in different environments is a critical skill. I agree that it is important to know how to build and maintain a Linux system. This includes installing from scratch and getting a web server and other services running. As well as having a running system and performing updates and be able to perform system maintenance. Learning to use bash effectively is something I really tryin to learn. I am familiar with the basic commands and syntax, but there are endless capabilities that a powerful utility like bash can be used for. There will always be more to learn.

### Individual Work vs Group Work

It is also important to work self sufficiently when working on individual tasks. Working though your own problems without taking time away from coworkers by using resources at your disposal such as searching online for the solution, or looking at examples of similar tasks. But it is also good to know when it is worth going to someone else for answers instead of wasting more of your own time on the issue. He recommends 30-60 minutes of attempting to figure things out yourself before interrupting someone else. I think this is a good rule of thumb, perhaps a bit sooner depending on the timeframe of the project. And he also recommends grouping multiple questions at once as to not repeatedly interrupt them. Along with that it is also very important to work well in groups and teams. You will often be collaborating with others and having code and projects that can be easily understood by others helps the whole process go smoothly and avoid delays of having to stop to explain every detail. An effective engineer can work well both individually and with others.
